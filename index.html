	<h3>Switch vs If/Else</h3>
	<p style="font-size=12">Sebastian</p>
	<p>Both switch and if/else statements are used to drive logic during. Switches are usually more compact and easier to read than if/else trees.

	<h3>= vs ==</h3>
	<p style="font-size=12">Sebastian</p>
	<p>The difference between = and == is simple once the meaning of each is understood. The '==' operator will compare the value of the variable on the left
		with the value of the right. If they are of the same value, then the result of the use of that operator is true, otherwise it is false.
		The '=' operator assigns the value of the variable on the right to the variable on the left.</p>

	<h3>Parameter vs Argument</h3>
	<p style="font-size=12">Sebastian</p>
	<p>Parameters and arguments are often used interchangably, but there is a difference between them. Arguments are values passed into a function call, and parameters are variables defined in the function to receive them.
		A parameter represents a value that the procedure expects you to pass when you call it. The procedure's declaration defines its parameters. 
		An argument represents the value that you pass to a procedure parameter when you call the procedure. The calling code supplies the arguments when it calls the procedure. <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9kewt1b3.aspx"> Taken from
		Microsoft's documentation for Visual Basic</a> but the definition stands true for Java also.</p>

	<h3>From double to int</h3>

	<p>/**
     * Returns a string representation of the {@code double}
     * argument. All characters mentioned below are ASCII characters.
     * <ul>
     * <li>If the argument is NaN, the result is the string
     *     "{@code NaN}".
     * <li>Otherwise, the result is a string that represents the sign and
     * magnitude (absolute value) of the argument. If the sign is negative,
     * the first character of the result is '{@code -}'
     * ({@code '\u005Cu002D'}); if the sign is positive, no sign character
     * appears in the result. As for the magnitude <i>m</i>:
     * <ul>
     * <li>If <i>m</i> is infinity, it is represented by the characters
     * {@code "Infinity"}; thus, positive infinity produces the result
     * {@code "Infinity"} and negative infinity produces the result
     * {@code "-Infinity"}.
     *
     * <li>If <i>m</i> is zero, it is represented by the characters
     * {@code "0.0"}; thus, negative zero produces the result
     * {@code "-0.0"} and positive zero produces the result
     * {@code "0.0"}.
     *
     * <li>If <i>m</i> is greater than or equal to 10<sup>-3</sup> but less
     * than 10<sup>7</sup>, then it is represented as the integer part of
     * <i>m</i>, in decimal form with no leading zeroes, followed by
     * '{@code .}' ({@code '\u005Cu002E'}), followed by one or
     * more decimal digits representing the fractional part of <i>m</i>.
     *
     * <li>If <i>m</i> is less than 10<sup>-3</sup> or greater than or
     * equal to 10<sup>7</sup>, then it is represented in so-called
     * "computerized scientific notation." Let <i>n</i> be the unique
     * integer such that 10<sup><i>n</i></sup> &le; <i>m</i> {@literal <}
     * 10<sup><i>n</i>+1</sup>; then let <i>a</i> be the
     * mathematically exact quotient of <i>m</i> and
     * 10<sup><i>n</i></sup> so that 1 &le; <i>a</i> {@literal <} 10. The
     * magnitude is then represented as the integer part of <i>a</i>,
     * as a single decimal digit, followed by '{@code .}'
     * ({@code '\u005Cu002E'}), followed by decimal digits
     * representing the fractional part of <i>a</i>, followed by the
     * letter '{@code E}' ({@code '\u005Cu0045'}), followed
     * by a representation of <i>n</i> as a decimal integer, as
     * produced by the method {@link Integer#toString(int)}.
     * </ul>
     * </ul>
     * How many digits must be printed for the fractional part of
     * <i>m</i> or <i>a</i>? There must be at least one digit to represent
     * the fractional part, and beyond that as many, but only as many, more
     * digits as are needed to uniquely distinguish the argument value from
     * adjacent values of type {@code double}. That is, suppose that
     * <i>x</i> is the exact mathematical value represented by the decimal
     * representation produced by this method for a finite nonzero argument
     * <i>d</i>. Then <i>d</i> must be the {@code double} value nearest
     * to <i>x</i>; or if two {@code double} values are equally close
     * to <i>x</i>, then <i>d</i> must be one of them and the least
     * significant bit of the significand of <i>d</i> must be {@code 0}.
     *
     * <p>To create localized string representations of a floating-point
     * value, use subclasses of {@link java.text.NumberFormat}.
     *
     * @param   d   the {@code double} to be converted.
     * @return a string representation of the argument.
